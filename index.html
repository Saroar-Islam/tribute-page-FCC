                        Mr. Bean is a British sitcom created by Rowan Atkinson
                        and Richard Curtis, produced by Tiger Aspect and
                        starring Atkinson as the title character.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The series was originally broadcast on ITV, beginning
                        with the pilot on 1 January 1990.
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        The sitcom consists of 15 episodes that were co-written
                        by Atkinson alongside Curtis and Robin Driscoll; for the
                        pilot, it was co-written by Ben Elton.
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        The series is based on a character developed by Atkinson
                        while he was studying for his master's degree at the
                        University of Oxford.
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        The series centres on Mr. Bean, described by Atkinson as
                        "a child in a grown man's body", as he solves various
                        problems presented by everyday tasks and often causes
                        disruption in the process.
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        During its original five-year run, Mr. Bean was met with
                        widespread acclaim and attracted large television
                        audiences.
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        The series was viewed by 18.74 million viewers for the
                        episode "The Trouble with Mr. Bean"[3] and has received
                        a number of international awards, including the Rose
                        d'Or.
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        The series has since been sold in 245 territories
                        worldwide.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        It has inspired an animated spin-off and two theatrical
                        feature-length films along with Atkinson reprising his
                        role as Mr. Bean for a performance at the London 2012
                        Summer Olympics opening ceremony, television commercials
                        and several sketches for Comic Relief.

                        The title character and protagonist, played by Rowan
                        Atkinson, who brings various unusual schemes and
                        contrivances to everyday tasks.

                    <li>
                        Mr Bean rarely speaks, and when he does, it is generally
                        only a few mumbled words which are in a comically
                        low-pitched voice.

                    <li>
                        The humour largely comes from his original (and often
                        absurd) solutions to problems and his total disregard
                        for others when solving them, and his pettiness and
                        occasional malevolence.

                    <li>
                        Seven years following the end of the original
                        live-action series, Mr. Bean reappeared in an animated
                        television series. The series introduced a list of new
                        characters alongside regulars in the original series.
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        Two theatrical feature-length films featuring Mr. Bean
                        have been released, with Atkinson reprising his role as
                        the character in each. The first film was named just
                        "Bean". And the second one was Mr. Bean's Holiday.
